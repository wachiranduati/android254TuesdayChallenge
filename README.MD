##GIVING CHANGE
Implement a program that helps a cashier give change.
####Level 1
The program has two inputs
1. The amount due as change, that is entered by teh cashier.
2. The amount to be issued to the customer in terms of Notes and Coins that the customer should receive

**Should run on a terminal This is a core language questions**

##How to Test this
1. Other than the usual cloning of the repo ;)
> git clone https://github.com/wachiranduati/android254TuesdayChallenge.git
2. *cd* into the folder via terminal and launch *app.py*
3. Into the cashier prompt enter a value you (the cashier) intend to return as change. Hit Enter.
4. This next prompt assumes that you are the customer and wish to have your change returned in specific denominations
> Enter comma seperated integer values of yoru denominations taking care not to have commas before the values else an error will be thrown
> The result will be your denominations starting with the highest denomination and its count to the lowest denomination and its count.
